# My experience on my web browsers

If you are a qutebrowser user, you can recognize that `autoconf.yml` is a
configuration of the qutebrowser web broser. And I would say that this
configuration is very minimalist with the consideration that this deletes every
cookie stored everytime I open a website like YouTube. Unfortunatelly with this
configuration, you can't access to your email... maybe I would try to use
thunderbird, but I'm lazy to do that :P

By the way, I recommend this
[site reommended by RMS](https://spyware.neocities.org/articles/firefox)
to convert firefox into a web browser "free" of malware. It worked for me to my
day by day navigation avoiding unwilling actions.

Of course, this thing means nothing to your daily actions on your computer. But
anyway, I leave this thing because it works to me :smiley:
