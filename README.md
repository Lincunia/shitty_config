# My configuration

---

As you notice at the beginning, this is just another nvim-dotfile that I've
made from scratch with the purpose of learning how to configurate my Neovim.
But if you want to look for a better Neovim setup I would recommend you to use
one of these:

- [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)
- [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
- [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)
- [LunarVim dotfiles](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch/)
- [CosmicNvim](https://github.com/CosmicNvim/CosmicNvim)

This the web-browser I'm currently using:

- [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/)

---

I use these fonts for my personal use from
[nerd-fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/font-downloads) :

- Iosevka NF
- FantasqueSansM Nerd Font
- 3270 Nerd Font Mono

This is the content of my `~/.config/fontconfig/fonts.conf`:

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE fontconfig SYSTEM "urn:fontconfig:fonts.dtd">
<fontconfig>
	<alias>
		<family>sans-serif</family>
		<prefer>
			<family>3270 Nerd Font Mono</family>
		</prefer>
	</alias>
</fontconfig>
```

This is my [i3status](./i3/.i3status.conf) and [Window Manager](./i3/config)
configuration (Don't judge me to use the default configuration from Manjaro,
please).
