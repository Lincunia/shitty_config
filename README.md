# My configuration

As you notice at the beginning, this is just another nvim-dotfile that I've
made from scratch with the purpose of learning how to configurate my Neovim.
But if you want to look for a better Neovim setup I would recommend you to use
one of these:

 * [NvChad](https://nvchad.com/)
 * [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/)
 * [AstroNvim](https://astronvim.com/)
 * [LunarVim dotfiles](https://github.com/LunarVim/Neovim-from-scratch/)
 * [CosmicNvim](https://github.com/CosmicNvim/CosmicNvim)

And here you have my browser:
 * [Qutebrowser](https://qutebrowser.org/)
